This is a game engine, which is acts as building blocks to easily create any game in java.
You will need to know the basics of programming in java to continue (variables, methods, loops, etc)
This game engine is heavily based on the Unity game engine.
Most of what applies there will also apply to some extent here.
Documentation for Unity can be found here (https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/UnityOverview.html)

This game engine is still a work-in-progress
Which means features will be added later down the line. This game engine is only for 2D (for now?)
